# CEG 4410 Homework1

### Text Color Changer and Drawing Application
This is the first assignement for CEG 4110. In this application, the user can easily switch between two tabbed activities by swiping left and right on the screen, or by pressing on the desired tab. In the first activity, the user is able to type into the textfield and change the color of the text with the click of a button. In the second activity, there is an open canvas for users to draw with a wide range of colors to choose from. The user has the option to start over with a clear button, change color with another button, and save his/her image to the phones internal storage with a save button. 

## MainActivity.java Class
The `MainActivity` is where all of the function calls are. There is an `onOptionsItemSelected(Menu)` method which allows the user to interact with the interfaces `home` and `up` buttons. Then there is a `SectionsPagerAdapter` method that `extends FragmentPagerAdapter`. This method contains a `switch` statement which is what allows the user to move between tabs. 

 ## Color.java Class

 The `color` class is dedicated to the functionality of the first tab, also titled `Color Tab`. This is a fragment class, so at the top `extends Fragment` must be included. For this part of the application, there is an empty textfield with a `hint` displayed in it. The user is able to enter text, click the button, and this generates a random color while displaying the aRGB values of the color, along with the Hex value of the color.
 
 The random color is generated by individually assigning random colors to variables `r`, `g`, and `b`. These values are then placed into a new `color1` variable. Then, the `editText` fields color is set to the randomly generated color. Once the text color has been changed, in order to get the hex value of the randomly generated color, 
 a new String `color1` is made and called through ``Integer.toHexString()``.
 
 ## Draw.java Class

 The `draw` class is geared towards the second tab, titled `Draw Tab`. This class also `extends Fragment` due to it being a fragment class. In this tab, users are able to draw, clear the canvas, and save their creations using buttons. The buttons are given functionality by and passing the `key ID` of the designated button from its `XML` layout through `rootView.findViewById()`. This tab also allows users to select between colors using `RGB` sliders. Since this is the fragment class, it essentially houses all `onClick` methods that get passed into `MainActivity`.
 
 Each button is set with a new `View.onClickListener()` and each one operates in its own way. The `CLEAR` button clears all paths and gives the user a blank canvas to draw on. The `COLOR` button prompts the user with `RGB` sliders to create a color he/she wishes to use. The `SAVE` button allows the user to save their drawing to the phones internal storage, as long as the user gives permission. The user should be prompted about allowing the application to access internal storage. If given permission, the user will be notified via a `Toast`.

 Since this is a newer version on Android, run time permissions are needed. There is a `requestStorePerm()` method which is what requests the users permission to store data. Inside of this method, there are alert dialogs and buttons to either allow or deny permission. There is another method `onRequestedPermissionsResult()` which attempts to match the `trm`, aka `Storage Permission Code` with that of the `requestCode`. If these match, the user is application is granted access. Then the `saveMe()` method takes a `Bitmap` as its parameter and that is the image to be saved. In this method a new file is created using `Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()`. The method then does a `try` and creates a new `FileOutputStream` with the newly created file. If it succeeds, the image is saved as a `PNG`.
 
 ## Canvas.java Class
 This class is a custom canvas. It houses all of the meat for the `canvas`, and most `buttons`. A list of methods that are called in the prior class are:
 * `changeColor()` - Sets the color of the paint to what the user selects.
 * `clearPath()` - Closes the path when a new color is selected, allowing multiple colors.
 * `clearCanvas()` -- Removes all paths and creates a new canvas for the user.
 The rest of the class consists of initializing values and methods that allow functionality when the screen is interacted with, such as `onTouchEvent()`. This method keep track of when the user is pressing on the sreen and when the user lets off of the screen.
 
 ### Dependencies
 
 There was one dependency used while making this application, and that was a color picker library. This was synced with the `build.gradle`. 
 
 `dependencies {
 implementation 'com.pes.materialcolorpicker:library:1.2.4'
 }`
 
 
 
 `packagingOptions {
        pickFirst 'lib/armeabi-v7a/libassmidi.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/x86/libassmidi.so'
}`
    
Then at the bottom of the `Manifest.xml`, add `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>`
under the closing application tag to allow the image to be saved.
